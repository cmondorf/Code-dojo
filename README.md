#Code dojo - (almost) daily code workouts

On an almost daily basis, I spend some time with a new coding problem from [CodeWars](www.codewars.com), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) or other sources. I collect my solutions or work-in-progress files here.

I'm aware these sites discourage the publication of working solutions, but as no one will find these without googling them to begin with I don't see they harm anyone who wasn't serious about solving the problems themselves anyway.

In some cases there is a filename with an "-alt" extension. These are solutions other people have coded and which I've found noteworthy. I've stored them here to study them more closely and they often includen notes I've made.

 This README was last updated July 2016.
